## How to use this template
See examples of this template being used in my previous Advent of Code projects.
* [advent-of-code-2019](https://github.com/TomPlum/advent-of-code-2019) was the year that establish the format of the codebase.
* [advent-of-code-2020](https://github.com/TomPlum/advent-of-code-2019) improved it a little bit.

Also see [advent-of-code-libs](https://github.com/TomPlum/advent-of-code-libs) where a lot of common code has been extracted. It's compiled in this template
via Gradle and is pulled from the GitHub packages registry.

## What is Advent of Code?

_Excerpt from the Advent of Code [website](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about);_

    "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets
    and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a
    speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or
    to challenge each other."
